## Polystat v0.2.0

This release introduced the following changes:

* The `--to console` cli argument was removed. Instead, the results of the analysis are printed to console by default. To disable printing the results to console, use the new `--quiet` flag (`-q` for short).
* Added a decent-looking pretty-printer of the analysis results to console.
* `j2eo` was updated to 0.6.0
* `py2eo` was updated to 0.23.0
